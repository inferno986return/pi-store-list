# pi-store-list
An attempt at an exhaustive list of apps and games there were on the Pi Store from 2012-2016. Mostly using information from images, blogs and the Wayback Machine. This project's goal is to document the history of the Pi Store and hopefully resuscitate a few projects.

## Background
The Pi Store was an app store not unlike the Apple App Store or Google Play for the Raspberry Pi and was launched on [17 December, 2012](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/introducing-the-pi-store/) through a collaboration between the Raspberry Pi Foundation and the now-defunct IndieCity. It hosted many different projects, most of them were free and others cost a small amount of money usually between £1.99 to £4.99 GBP.

The Pi Store was forced to close in January 2015 after an apparent EU ruling that disallowed a not-for-profit such as the Raspberry Pi Foundation from operating a for-profit storefront, as such the Pi Store was closed down and is now considered a mere piece of the Raspberry Pi's history.
